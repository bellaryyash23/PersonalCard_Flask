# ðŸŽ´Personal Visiting Card using Flask of Python, HTML, CSS & JavaScript

ðŸŒŸA Web-Based Visiting Card which is like the old-school paper ones but Better. The designing i.e. the front-end is created using HTML, CSS & JavaScript. 
Python is used for back-end with Flask framework being used at the server side.

ðŸ‘‰The website body and structure is created in the 'Yash Bellary site.html' file. It is a minimalistic webpage similar to the paper style visiting cards.

ðŸ‘‰The css for the website design is created in the 'main.css' file. The use of Font Awesome templates and HTML5 templates is done to design the website, fonts and logos.

ðŸ‘‰Now, this designed website is serverd on the local server using the Flask framework. The use of Flask decorator functions and other classes is done for this process.

ðŸ‘‰In order to render the HTML, CSS & JavaScript files, some formating needs to be followed.

ðŸ‘‰With reference to the Flask documentation, the html files are stored in directory with name 'templates' while the static files like css file, images, js file, etc are
stored in the 'static' directory. 

ðŸ‘‰Once the formating is done, the Flask class 'render_templates()' is used to render the HTML, CSS & JavaScript on the local route served by the Flask server.
